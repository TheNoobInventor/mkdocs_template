# MkDocs Template
This bash script is used to create a markdown documentation template for any project. It utilizes the static site generator, [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/),
and the [material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/) to build project documentation. 

The script is well documented and each section can be edited to suit the required structure of the project.
